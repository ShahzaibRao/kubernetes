# Exposing Kubernetes Apps to the Internet with Cloudflare Tunnel, Ingress Controller, and ExternalDNS
in this tutorial, I will demonstrate how to configure Cloudflare Tunnel, external-dns, and an Ingress Controller to work together. We will create a single tunnel to Cloudflare using cloudflared, route traffic from Cloudflare to an Ingress Controller, and use this tunnel to expose applications to the internet through an Ingress resource. Additionally, we will use external-dns to automatically create all necessary DNS records in Cloudflare. This guide is designed to assist users looking to expose their services to the internet via Cloudflare with a focus on simple and home deployments.
